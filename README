DESCRIPTION
In forums, emails, documentation, or other plain-text files, one often embeds
references directly in the text. But many URLs are quite long, and this often
breaks the formatting and natural flow of the text. It would be better to
place those below the main text, in a neat reference section. But doing that
manually is tedious and error-prone.

This plugin leverages the :SubstituteAndYankUnique command of the
ExtractMatches.vim plugin (vimscript #4795) to extract the (configurable)
URLs found in the buffer and replace them with unique inline anchors.
Additionally, an (again configurable) table of anchor and extracted URL is
placed into a register, for easy pasting. The complete link extraction and
referencing is therefore reduced to a short and painless
    :ExtractMatches | $put

In addition to a general global default, the plugin ships with predefined
pattern and replacement definitions for:
- Markdown
[text](URL)
- HTML
[text] or [<a href="...">link</a>"]

USAGE
:[range]ExtractLinks [x]
                        Extract all links in [range] / the buffer with a
                        (filetype-specific, by default "[N]") unique
                        reference, and generate a corresponding link table
                        that associates the references with the respective
                        original links (default: "[N] {link}"). This is placed
                        into register [x] / the default register, so it can be
                            :$put
                       into the buffer (probably at the end, as a legend).

EXAMPLE
    This text references http://www.vim.org/ and http://w3.org/.
    :ExtractLinks
    This text references [1] and [2].
    :put
    [1] http://www.vim.org/
    [2] http://w3.org/
